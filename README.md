<h4>

I’m a Product Designer with 6 years of experience simplifying complex workflows across Enterprise, B2B, SaaS and community platforms. I specialize in turning messy, friction-heavy systems into intuitive, scalable experiences — grounded in systems thinking, research, and clean UI. 

My approach blends structure and creativity: I love bringing clarity to complexity, advocating for users, and designing with intention.

🎯 Currently Volunteering @Toronto JS Community as a Product Designer — shaping tools and experiences to streamline onboarding and engagement for the community.

💡 Design Roadmap — I started it as a side project to bring clarity to the overwhelming world of design resources. What began as a simple Notion Sheet has grown into a curated platform featuring 100+ trusted tools, design systems, portfolio builders, job boards, and inspiration links.

🎨 @desk4doodle — My personal art project where I share digital illustrations, affirmations, and creative experiments that bring joy and reflection. 

🌱 I believe great design balances empathy with intention — and I bring that mindset into every product, system, and interaction I design.

👀 Actively looking for UX/Product Design roles in Canada (Toronto/Remote).
